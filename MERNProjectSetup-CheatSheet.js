Project Structure and Summary:

Root Directory Files and Their Purposes:
- .gitignore: Lists files and folders to be ignored by version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env).
- package.json: Defines project-wide npm dependencies, scripts for running the server and client, and project metadata.
- package-lock.json: Automatically generated file to lock the versions of npm dependencies for consistent installs.
- README.md: Documentation for the project, including setup instructions, project overview, and other essential information.
- startup.sh: Bash script containing commands to start the project, useful for development environments or deployment setups.
- startupCheatSheet.txt: Contains explanations and documentation for the bash startup commands, aiding in project setup and management.

Directories:
- client/: Contains the React front-end application, including UI components, styles, and React setup files.
  - public/: Holds static files served by the React application.
    - index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React app; includes the root div where the React app mounts.
    - favicon.ico: Icon displayed in the browser tab for the website.
    - logo192.png & logo512.png: Logos used in the web app manifest for Progressive Web App (PWA) support on various devices and resolutions.
    - manifest.json: A JSON file that provides information about the web application in a JSON text file, necessary for the web app to be installed on a user's home screen, defining icons, the start URL, background color, display type, and orientation.
    - robots.txt: A text file webmasters create to instruct web robots (typically search engine robots) which pages on their site to crawl and which not to crawl, essential for SEO and web visibility.
  - src/: The source directory for React components, styles, tests, and JavaScript entry point.
    - pages/: Contains React components that represent different pages of the app, helping in organizing the application's routing and structure.
    - App.js: The root React component that serves as the main container for the application.
    - App.css: Contains styling specific to the App component.
    - App.test.js: Test file for the App component, used with testing libraries like Jest.
    - index.js: The entry point for the React application that renders the App component.
    - reportWebVitals.js: Optional tool for measuring the performance of your app using various metrics.
    - setupTests.js: Configures the testing environment, making it ready for writing and running tests.
  - package.json: Manages React-specific dependencies, scripts (e.g., start, build, test), and project settings.
  - .env: Stores environment variables for the React app, kept out of version control to secure sensitive data.

- server/: Houses the Express back-end application, API logic, database configurations, and server setup.
  - config.js: External configuration settings, such as database connection strings, meant to be kept out of version control for security.
  - APIManager.js: Manages the API logic, handling requests and responses, abstracting the interaction with databases or external services.
  - server.js: The main server file where the Express application is configured, routes are defined, and the server is started.

This setup provides a comprehensive structure for a MERN project, ensuring separation of concerns between client and server, clear organization, and ease of development and deployment.
